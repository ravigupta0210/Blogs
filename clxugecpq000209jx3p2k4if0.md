# Introduction

The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface used to interact with the operating system and various software. Unlike the Graphical User Interface (GUI), which relies on visual elements like icons and windows, the CLI uses typed commands to perform tasks.

---

### Why Use CLI?

* **Efficiency**: - Commands can perform complex tasks more quickly than navigating through menus.
    
* **Automation**: Scripts can automate repetitive tasks.
    
* **Resource-Friendly**: CLI consumes fewer system resources compared to GUI.
    
* **Remote Access**: CLI is essential for managing remote servers.

### Basic Commands

* **Navigating the Filesystem**
    
    * `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
        
        ```powershell
        pwd
        ```
        
    * `ls`: List files and directories.
        
        ```powershell
        ls
        ```
        
    * `cd`: Change directory.
        
        ```powershell
        cd /path/to/directory
        ```
        
    * `mkdir`: Create a new directory.
        
        ```powershell
        mkdir new_directory
        ```
        
    * `rmdir`: Remove an empty directory.
        
        ```powershell
        rmdir empty_directory
        ```
        
* **File Operations**
    
    * `touch`: Create an empty file.
        
        ```powershell
        touch newfile.txt
        ```
        
    * `cat`: Concatenate and display file content.
        
        ```powershell
        cat file.txt
        ```
        
    * `cp`: Copy files or directories.
        
        ```powershell
        cp sourcefile.txt destinationfile.txt
        cp -r sourcedir/ destinationdir/
        ```
        
    * `mv`: Move or rename files or directories.
        
        ```powershell
        mv oldname.txt newname.txt
        mv file.txt /path/to/destination/
        ```
        
    * `rm`: Remove files or directories.
        
        ```powershell
        rm file.txt
        rm -r directory/
        ```
        

**Text Manipulation**

* `echo`: Display a line of text.
    
    ```powershell
    echo "Hello, World!"
    ```
    
* `grep`: Search for patterns in text.
    
    ```powershell
    grep "pattern" file.txt
    ```
    
* `sed`: Stream editor for modifying text.
    
    ```powershell
    sed 's/oldtext/newtext/' file.txt
    ```
    

---

### Advanced Features

* **Piping and Redirection**
    
    * `|` (pipe): Pass the output of one command as input to another.
        
        ```powershell
        ls | grep "pattern"
        ```
        
    * `>`: Redirect output to a file.
        
        ```powershell
        echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt
        ```
        
    * `>>`: Append output to a file.
        
        ```powershell
        echo "Append this text" >> output.txt
        ```
        
    * `<`: Redirect input from a file.
        
        ```powershell
        cat < inputfile.txt
        ```
        

**Scripting**

* **Shell Scripts**: Write a series of commands in a file to be executed sequentially.
    
* **Variables and Loops**: Use variables and control structures like loops to create more dynamic scripts.
